# Grimstone-Texturepack
This is a Grimstone Texturepack with Optifine and 1.16 which let it look like there is Grimstone/Deepslate below Y=23

Old ore versions have the old (pre 1.17) ore textures, but with the new Deepslate/Grimstone Background!

The Deepslate V1 has the top texture of Deepslate on all sides, the ores and the stone. (Mistake by mine)

The Grimstone Variants are older ores and then the newer Designs

If you want to have another version, let me know here or on planetminecraft!
